\chapter{Introduction to Synchronous Digital Systems (SDS)}

\section{Synchronous Digital Systems}
Hardware of a processor (e.g. RISC-V) is a SDS.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Synchronous: All operations coordinated by a central clock $\implies$ control pulse.
    \item Digital: Discrete signals quantized to 0s and 1s.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Types of Circuits}
SDS are made of two basic types of circuits:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Stateless Combinational Logic (CL) circuits: Output is a function of the inputs only, no way to store information.
    \item State circuits: Circuits that store information (e.g. registers).
\end{enumerate}
