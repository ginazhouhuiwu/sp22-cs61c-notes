\section{The C Programming Language}
C is a low-level language whose lack of restrictions and generality make it effective for many tasks.

\subsection{Compilation}
C compilers map C programs directly into architecture-specific machine code (string of 1s and 0s).

\begin{itemize}
    \item Advantage: Optimizes for a given architecture \(\implies\) excellent runtime performance
    \item Disadvantage: Compiled files are architecture-specific \(\implies\) executable must be rebuilt on each new system (porting)
\end{itemize}
