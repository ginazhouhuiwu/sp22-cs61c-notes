\section{The C Programming Language}
C is a low-level language whose lack of restrictions and generality make it effective for many tasks.

\subsection{Compilation}
C compilers map C programs directly into architecture-specific machine code (string of 1s and 0s).

\begin{description}
    \item[Overview] Two part process of compiling source files (.c) to object files (.o), then linking the .o files into executables.

    C source files (.c) \(\rightarrow\) [Compiler/assembler] \(\rightarrow\) Machine code object files \& Prebuilt object file libraries (.o) \(\rightarrow\) [Linker] \(\rightarrow\) Machine code executable file (.out)
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Advantage: Optimizes for a given architecture \(\implies\) excellent runtime performance
        \item Disadvantage: Compiled files are architecture-specific \(\implies\) executable must be rebuilt on each new system (porting)
    \end{itemize}
